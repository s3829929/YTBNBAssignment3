<p>There have been a number of things that went well in our project. To start off the group had great communications. We discussed everything together and everybody was equally included in all aspects. This is an essential to any team and the whole team has executed this beautifully. We also had a diverse team who were good at different parts of the project. This helped up to divide the work easily and made the project fast and easy going. Additionally, we had a compassionate team where all members stood up for each other in times of need.</p>
<p>There is very less to improve in the team. We could have had more meetings but unfortunately the current situation doesnâ€™t allow us to so.
The surprising thing to me was the fact that the team members never sat together for an in-person meeting but still managed to have perfect communications and managed to do this project just of MS Teams. </p>
<p>The most important thing I have learned about groups is the value of teamwork and confidence.  A group can turn a huge complicated project to an easy task and provides different perspectives on the project. It also teaches us to be confident and voice our opinions as this might bring great improvements to a project. </p>
