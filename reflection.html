<h2>Liam's Reflection</h2>

<h2>Nick's Reflection</h2>
<p> Overall, I think the group did fairly well. 
	Everyone was able to do the part that was assigned to them. 
    As a group, we were able to come to each other and ask questions if we were not sure of something and everyone was willing to help each other. 
    What could be improved would be the communication between the group and each member, between myself and Tran specifically, because I was relying on him to do a certain part before I could start my part was frustrating, but as soon as the group explained to him he got it done as soon as he could, which was helpful, but in the future, he should read the assignment document and ask questions if he isn’t sure.
    One of the things that I found surprising was that when I was doing the timeframe, the length of the HTML for it was far longer than I thought it would be. Group-wise, it was surprising that we were able to do the work required in a short amount of time. One thing I learnt about groups was that sometimes it is much easier to divide the work than it is to do it by yourself. </p>
<h2>Prottay's Reflection</h2>
<p>There have been a number of things that went well in our project. To start off the group had great communications. We discussed everything together and everybody was equally included in all aspects. This is an essential to any team and the whole team has executed this beautifully. We also had a diverse team who were good at different parts of the project. This helped up to divide the work easily and made the project fast and easy going. Additionally, we had a compassionate team where all members stood up for each other in times of need.</p>
<p>There is very less to improve in the team. We could have had more meetings but unfortunately the current situation doesn’t allow us to so.
The surprising thing to me was the fact that the team members never sat together for an in-person meeting but still managed to have perfect communications and managed to do this project just of MS Teams. </p>
<p>The most important thing I have learned about groups is the value of teamwork and confidence.  A group can turn a huge complicated project to an easy task and provides different perspectives on the project. It also teaches us to be confident and voice our opinions as this might bring great improvements to a project. </p>
