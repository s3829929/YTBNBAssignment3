        The Git audit trail reflects the groups work both positively and negatively. It was positive in the sense that it shows who was doing work and who wasn't. 
        Conversely, it was negative because it doesn't quite accurately show who's done what because one person may be resposible for the compiling of the report and thus their numbers would be inflated 
        and thus reflect poorly on the amount of work each group member has done.
