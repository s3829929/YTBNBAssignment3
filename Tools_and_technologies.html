        <h1>Tools and Technologies</h1>
        <p>
            The hardware needed for this project, other than a computer and an internet connection, is a server to host connections between users. 
            As for software, any software development platform would do, such as <a href = "https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/">Visual Studio</a>.
            Some software would also be required to handle information that travels from the user to the server, such as <a href = "https://www.capterra.com/p/141792/Pulseway/#about">Pulseway</a>.
            Cybersecurity software is also essential as the protection of the users information is paramount, programs such as <a href= "https://www.telstra.com.au/small-business/business-services/business-cyber-security-services">Telstra business-cyber-security-services</a> would be ideal here. 
            Github would be used to store work as it is being developed.
        </p>
        <p>
            As for prior knowledge, the whole group has experience using Github from the previous assignment as well as this one. 
            Other than that no-one has any experience with any of the other technologies listed, which would be a hurdle to overcome as new skills would need to be learned.
