        <h1>Testing</h1>
        <p>
            Testing is an integral part of software development, as such many tests will be performed in order to ensure that the Movie Night will be at its best when the time comes to deploy it.
            There are many different types of testing, however not all are applicable to this software. The types of testing that will be used when developing are:
            <ul>
                <li>Alpha testing</li>
                <li>Beta testing</li>
                <li>Browser testing</li>
                <li>Accessibility testing</li>
                <li>Compatibility testing</li>
                <li>End-to-end testing</li>
                <li>Alpha testing</li>
                <li>Integration tesing</li>
                <li>Performance testing</li>
                <li>Recovery testing</li>
                <li>Security testing</li>
                <li>Usability testing</li>
            </ul>
            It is possible that in the future more types of testing is required, however, the ones listed above are the most important regarding this software currently.
        </p>
        <p>
            To test the usability of the software, test users are required. Realistically, the more people willing to test, the better, however, depending on the stage of production could alter the number of people required.
            For example, if the "group" mode was the part that was getting tested, only a small number of groups would be required, approximately 15 (3 groups of 5), would be required to test this function. 
            However, in this case of the "streamer" mode, a significantly greater number of people would be required to test, not only to see if it works, but also to see if servers can handle the stress of so many people, an approximate number would be around 1000 although this number could increase depending on the initial popularity.
            The way that users would be found is mainly through posting on forums and websites such as reddit, usertesting.com (mainly for the interface, not so much for performance testing) and other online platforms. Users do not need to have any background, however familiarity with basic computer knowledge would be ideal.
        </p>
        <p>
           Depending on the type of tests done, the definition of success varies. 
           Success could mean that the software works or that it doesn't crash, regarding stress testing, it could mean that the servers can handle the load of hundreds, if not thousands, of users.
