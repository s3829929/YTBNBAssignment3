<p>While working with this group, I have realized that my group is very good on helping each other out. Since the last
assignment, when someone is stuck on something like GitHub or the part that they are currently doing, they will receive
help immidiately. Even though the time when we started working on this project is pretty late, but the fact that we 
already assigned each group member with a particular task to be done, we still able to make it on time while also maintain 
the good quality of this project.</p>
<p>In my opinion, due to the fact that only Liam and Nicholas have English as their first language, most of the group meetings 
are just these two talking to each other. I am not denying other's contribution on this assignment but it would be better if 
other three, including me, can talk more so that we can improve our confidence and speaking skill.</p>
<p>It very surprised me that even after Paco left and give a man disadvantage to our group, we were still able to cover all 
of his part. We were a bit struggle at the beginning but later on, it is no longer a huge deal to our group anymore 
and we did manage to overcome it easily.</p>
<p>The most important thing that I have learned from this is that how a good teamwork can lead to the positive outcome of the
group project. This is what all the member's were very good on and I can conclude that my group is very close to a perfect group.</p>
